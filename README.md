- Lane_det.py is where the full pipeline for lane detection and its outputs is and can be run
- Detect.py is where you want to run yolov5, and lane_det.py functions are copied into this script as well
- To run detect.py from camera type: python3.9 detect.py --source 0
- Currently, pipeline (lane_detection function) is called on im0 (image with no object detection) after its undistorted on line 315
- The bounding boxes for yolo can be accessed at lines 327 (coordinates for box) and 328 (class of box)
